# Wireless Light Control
An Arduino project to turn the light on and off at distance (lazyness is movitavion :P)

It takes:

- 2 Arduinos Pro Mini ATmega328P 5V 16MHz
- 1 433Mhz AM RF Transmitter
- 1 433Mhz AM RF Receiver
- 1 Relay module (I got a module with 2 relays, though only using one)


## Work in Progress ##

#### DONE:

- Source codes 
- Communication tested in a veeeery close range
- Relay activation working properly

#### TODO:

- Wire some antennas and test longer distance communication
- Make schematics (and put them here)
- Power supplies (batteries? convert domestic AC to 5V DC?) 
- Install it to the light electrical wiring
- Cases (?)


## Acknowledgements:

- I bought all my stuff at http://www.filipeflop.com/ (Brazil only, I guess)
- The long corridor in my house I have to walk to turn its light out and come back stumbling at everything in the way.
